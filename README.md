# Covid-19-Data-Pipeline-
COVID-19 data pipeline project:

Built a robust COVID-19 data pipeline using Python and Pandas, extracting data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) dataset. Applied data cleaning and transformation techniques to ensure data accuracy and consistency, enabling accurate analysis and decision-making.

Designed and implemented a scalable database solution using SQLite/MySQL to store and manage the transformed COVID-19 data. Developed an efficient database schema, optimized query performance, and ensured data integrity, resulting in streamlined data retrieval and analysis.

Developed a fully automated data pipeline by leveraging cron scheduling, enabling regular updates of the COVID-19 database with the latest data. Configured the pipeline to execute at specific intervals, ensuring up-to-date information for analysis and reporting purposes.

Utilized data visualization tools (e.g., Matplotlib, Tableau) to create comprehensive visualizations and reports on COVID-19 trends, including infection rates, mortality rates, and geographical distribution. Effectively communicated insights to stakeholders, aiding in informed decision-making and resourceÂ allocation.
